## VT Conservation Docs  

This is a collection of spatial workflows for teaching and doing conservation planning. 

### Data 

The data used by the scripts can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1H_9ShSYgT1qYIMOfpEarzISFqd3OnGSu?usp=sharing). 

You will need to:  

1. Download the dataset.  
2. Place it in a local folder.
3. Update the script so that the input data variable points to your local path.

### Practice

This folder contains a set of practice scripts. These introduce the workflows and provide a sandbox to play with the parameters.  

| Script    | Description   |
| :--       | :---          |
| [_01_simple_landforms.py][01] | Classify landforms from a 10m DEM with geomorphons. | 
| [_02_valley_bottoms.py][02]   | Resample a high resolution DEM, classify landforms with geomorphons, and threshold to isolate valley bottoms. |
